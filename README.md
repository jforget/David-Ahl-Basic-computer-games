PURPOSE
=======

Since late 2022, generative artificial intelligence is available to anyone
with an Internet connection. I have even been told that some people use
IA chat programs as psychoanalysts. That reminds me of a forerunner of
AI psychoanalysts, Eliza, written in the 1960's.

The BASIC  version of Eliza  was published  in David Ahl's  book _More
Computer Games_, a  sequel of his best-seller  _Basic Computer Games_.
So  my interest  in  Eliza  expanded into  an  interest  in the  Basic
computer games from these books.

This repository describes  my efforts to get these  computer games and
to  run  them.   the  repo  does  not  contain  the   games,  but  the
documentation gives links to retrieve the games.
