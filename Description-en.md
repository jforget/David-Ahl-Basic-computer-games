PURPOSE
=======

Since late 2022, generative artificial intelligence is available to anyone
with an Internet connection. I have even been told that some people use
IA chat programs as psychoanalysts. That reminds me of a forerunner of
AI psychoanalysts, Eliza, written in the 1960's.

The BASIC  version of Eliza  was published  in David Ahl's  book _More
Computer Games_, a  sequel of his best-seller  _Basic Computer Games_.
So  my interest  in  Eliza  expanded into  an  interest  in the  Basic
computer games from these books.

This repository describes  my efforts to get these  computer games and
to run them.

GAME PROGRAMS
=============

Eliza
-----

[Eliza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA)
was not written  by David Ahl, but by Joseph  Weizenbaum. Many sources
are provided by
[a Github repository](https://github.com/jeffshrager/elizagen.org),
in various programming languages. Since I am interested only in Basic
versions, I have selected, more or less randomly,
[a 1979 version](https://github.com/jeffshrager/elizagen.org/blob/master/Other_Elizas/1979_EricPlatt_DR_CHALLENGER_CLEAN.BAS),
[a 2013 version](https://github.com/jeffshrager/elizagen.org/blob/master/Other_Elizas/20130209_www.jesperjuul.net%7Celiza%7CELIZA.BAS)
available at
[another address](https://jesperjuul.net/eliza/ELIZA.BAS)
and [another 2013 version](https://github.com/jeffshrager/elizagen.org/blob/3f3414c8a3e359e5f392d92883241d3bd41e7988/Other_Elizas/20120310ShragerNorthEliza.c64basic).

Basic Computer Games
--------------------

[Both](https://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/)
[books](https://www.atariarchives.org/morebasicgames/)
by David Ahl are available from
[Atari Archives](https://www.atariarchives.org/),
with a
[third book](https://www.atariarchives.org/bigcomputergames/)
I did not know about. Among all the programs, we certainly find
[Eliza](https://www.atariarchives.org/morebasicgames/showpage.php?page=56).

The problem  is that these  files are available  as GIF images.  So we
need  some OCR  programs  to  convert them  into  ASCII source  files.
Fortunately, the programs  from the first book are available  as a Zip
archive and as a tar.gz archive on the
[Vintage Basic webpage](http://www.vintage-basic.net/games.html).

The first two books are also available on the
[archive.org]((https://archive.org/details/basic-computer-games-microcomputer-edition_202207)
[website](https://archive.org/details/More_BASIC_Computer_Games),
displaying the  contents as GIF images  (or JPEG? or PNG?).  There are
links to download the whole book as a text file or as a PDF file. Yet,
in the text files, there are  many OCR errors. However, this can still
be  a starting  point to  retrieve the  source file  for such  or such
program.
